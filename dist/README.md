# Dist

> A.K.A. `Distribution`

This folder includes all builds of your project such as:

- Debug
- Beta/Prerelease
- Release

---

It is recommended to exclude this folder in your final commit using a `.gitignore` file in the root of your project, and instead use Github releases (ProCMP automatically handles Github release deployment)
