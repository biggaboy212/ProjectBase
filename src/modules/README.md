# Modules

This folder should include reusable modules that are included across source files such as:

- A UI Library
- An ESP library
- An aimbot module

> [!NOTE]  
> That does not neccessarily mean it's project *exclusive*, just that it's not a directly imported library or module. For that, use the [packages](../packages) folder.
